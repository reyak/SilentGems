Creation/Discovery: Gems can be found as ore blocks all over the overworld, the nether, and certain (most that I've seen) modded dimensions. These gems do not need to be smelted, as the "ore" breaks into gems moderately resembling diamonds, or emeralds.

Use: Gems can be crafted into swords and tools in the same pattern as any diamond, or metal with (a) stick(s) on the bottom, and the gems on top. They can also be crafted into armor, placing four gems (top, bottom, and one on each side) around an armor pattern made with Armor Latice, which is made from Fluffy Fabric, which is made from Fluffy Puffs... which sounds far more complicated than it really is...

An upgraded, or Super gem can be made, combining it with Chaos ore and glowstone dust (redstone dust in earlier versions). These are simply stronger, more durable, and faster versions of the original gems. Tools with super gems require Ornate rods, rather than just sticks. Each gem, and super gem have states that can be seen by holding CTRL (control key) while hovering over the gem with your cursor.

Gems can also be crafted into Bandoleirs, which are basically torch 'pouches' which can hold about a thousand torches... I think...

There are many more recipes for gems, and gem shards (created like iron nuggets), that I might add later, or on seporate pages.
